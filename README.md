# emken

"emken" is a medical emergency web application where people go to seek information on various medical emergency cases and learn what to do during such situations. Additionally, by clicking on the 'Find Hospital' option, you can access a map providing directions to hospitals in your area. "emken" also offers a "Chat with Doctor" feature, allowing authenticated users to choose from available emken doctors for medical-related information or advice. Please note that there are currently no available doctors, but that's the concept we have in mind for this feature.
