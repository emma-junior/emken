    name: "Asthmatic attack",
    category: "Acute Emergency",
    overview: "During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, the airways become swollen and inflamed. The muscles around the airways contract and the airways produce extra mucus, causing the breathing (bronchial) tubes to narrow. \n During an attack, you may cough, wheeze and have trouble breathing. Symptoms of a minor asthma attack get better with prompt home treatment. A severe asthma attack that doesn't improve with home treatment can become a life-threatening emergency.",
    symptoms: ["Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, and coughing or wheezing", "Low peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings, if you use a peak flow meter", "Symptoms that fail to respond to use of a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler"],
    treatment: ["Move away from all triggers like dust, smoke, perfumes etc", "Take 2 to 3 puffs of your salbutamol inhaler", "If the difficulty in breathing does not improve, get to the nearest hospital immediately."],

    name: "Heart attack",
    category: "Acute Emergency",
    overview: "A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. The blockage is usually due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process of plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis. \n Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. A lack of blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.",
    symptoms: ["Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching", "Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or sometimes the upper belly", "Cold sweat"],
